* Add functions to set multiple glyphs at once (e.g. SetLine, SetBox, SetBorder, etc.).
	- Ideally, these should take std::functions.
* Consider tying Shaders as a static reference to GlyphSets, Backgrounds, etc. A GlyphSet, ideally, should only use 1 Shader.
* Set up Background class.
	- This holds a background that appears behind the glyphs.
* Set up StateManager class.
	- A state should encompass a GlyphSet, Background, InputState, EventState, ScriptState & AudioState.
	- States should be held in a stack.
* Set up InputState class.
	- This manages what inputs are bound to what events for the current State.
* Set up EventState class.
	- This manages the events (i.e. input or script-related) that're fired in the current State.
* Set up ScriptState class.
	- This manages the Lua scripts, and handles any related events for the current State.
* Set up AudioState class.
	- This manages sounds and music to play for the current State.
